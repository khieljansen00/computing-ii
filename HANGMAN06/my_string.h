// lab 3 is easy
// just code the two following functions which shall help for adding and
// subtracting chars. refer to the class notes. malloc a temp data variable
// and free the old data variable and assign string data as new temp var.

// figure out how to check for whitespace (" ", "\n", "\t").
// notice these characters: \0 and EOF.

// stdin, stdout, and stderr are predefined text streams with std::FILE* type.

// these functions are important: fgetc(), fopen(), fclose()
// maybe feof()

// extraction takes in a handle to my_string and a file pointer
// all you have to do is replace the my_string data variable with a new one.
// you could try to free it initially and then replace it with a default() call
// which mallocs a new one for you. make sure to watch for memory leaks.
// and then let the functions do the work for you.
// the outcome is that my_string has a string from the file in the data variable.
// (returning SUCCESS too).
// FAILURE occurs if handle is false or if temp is false or if temp is false after
// replace. (maybe more).

// insertion is easy, just grab the data variable which is a char* type
// from the MY_STRING handle.
// FAILURE occurs if handle is false or if data is false.
// and output it to the FILE* variable which could be a text stream like stdout.

// these functions return a bool type which is either SUCCESS or FAILURE
